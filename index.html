    <h1>Alex Sims' Resume</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The reason I am writing this resume is as a capstone project for the
      <a
        href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/"
        >Udemy Web Developer Course I am undertaking.</a
      >
      As a capstone project we were given a brief to create a website that would
      act as a job resume just using HTML and everything we have learned up
      until now. Although the content of this website is true it isn't meant to
      be a finished article that I would submit as part of my portfolio. I will
      when I have finished the course update it with everything I know and
      reference this site within it.
